				<p>Carleton University is located in Ottawa, Canada and celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2017. It is seated between the Rideau River and the Rideau Canal, and boasts an ever-growing campus and a wide variety of innovative programs.</p>
				<p>I will be graduating in December 2017, after completing 1 final course in the Interactive Multimedia and Design stream of a Bachelor of Information Technology. This is a joint program between Carleton University and Algonquin College, and has exposed me to a wide variety of topics and projects, ranging from graphic design to 3d animation to sensor-based interaction to user-oriented design and agile development.</p>
