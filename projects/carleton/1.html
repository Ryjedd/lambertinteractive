				<h4>Goal</h4>
				<p>This was my Senior Project. Our goal was to create a system to help blind users navigate interior spaces safely without the need for a cane or guide dog.</p>
				<h4>Skills/Tools Used</h4>
				<p>Google Tango, Arduino, actuators, leds, Bluetooth, Unity, C#, cloth and materials, sewing machine, portable battery charger</p>

			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(April 2016 - April 2017)</p>
			<p>Project Marko is a navigation tool for the blind that provides a new method of navigation and obstacle avoidance. We use Google’s Tango tablet to develop a virtual, three-dimensional map of the environment to track the user’s position relative to walls and obstacles and communicate that to the user through vibrations. My role in this project was officially the Android/Interface developer, however I had a prominent role in all software development, ranging from computer vision to Bluetooth communication to sensor activation on the Arduino side. Please contact me if you would like to learn more about it, as there is way too much to fit in this summary.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>Project Marko was the largest project I have undertaken so far and came with a lot of ups and downs. It required significant research and even more problem solving. I delved deeper into many concepts and tools, including object-oriented programming, Unity, C#, Arduino, and Bluetooth. It also served as an important experience with experimental technology and dealing with problems that no one else has yet experienced. Furthermore, a great deal of this project revolved around designing for and testing with blind users, and it was a great feeling when hearing positive feedback in regards to our design choices. Most of all, it was a lesson in perseverence, as the countless hours of testing and sitting in hallways early into the morning before a demonstration wore down our spirit. This made it so much sweeter when everything finally came together 3 hours before our make-or-break status presentation.</p>
