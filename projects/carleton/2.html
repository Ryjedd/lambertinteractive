			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(January 2017 - March 2017)</p>
			<p>This project mixed journalism students with multimedia students to create an interactive journalism piece. Although I was not a journalism student, I decided to take on the role of Story Lead in order to learn some skills I might otherwise never have had exposure to. I wanted to convey the excitement of this little-known sport through fast-paced footage and cuts. We were luckily able to get access to 2 competing athletes, who provided us with GoPro footage and exclusive footage within the athlete's tent. Despite frigid temperatures and some technical issues, we were also able to acquire some decent footage of the races, which was compiled by myself and another teammate into a story that I feel captures the excitement that I was looking for. Other team members, meanwhile, were developing an interactive website which showcased additional facts and information about the sport at timed intervals throughout the video.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>Working with journalism students gave me a crash course in developing and presenting a story, as well as how to ask meaningful questions in an interview. As I conducted each interview, I received feedback from my journalism partner, which resulted in each interview producing higher quality information. I believe this will be of great use in conducting user interviews and user testing. Furthermore, it gave me significant experience in taking large quantities of varied information and content and formulating it into a coherent, engaging story.</p>
