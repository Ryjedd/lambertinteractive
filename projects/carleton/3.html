			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(January 2016 - April 2016)</p>
			<p>Project Creature was an attempt at a reactive AI. We had no prior experience with AI and went into this with no research into existing methods, determined to develop our own approach. Initially planned as a pet that reacted to the world around it, we were encouraged to add a story of some kind. The goal ended up being to guide the character to the purple area at the end of the video by teaching him how to climb over logs and interact with other obstacles. In the end, this got tangled with the initial reactive AI, resulting in things not working properly. We learned a lot, however, and would like to revisit a similar project in the future.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This was my first project that I honestly felt I had failed at. It was a good lesson in project management and scope, but more importantly, it was a reminder that failure is not the end. I had a hard time looking at this project for a while, but now I look at it with a desire to go back to it someday, starting from scratch with more research and planning. This project was also an introduction to Unity.</p>
