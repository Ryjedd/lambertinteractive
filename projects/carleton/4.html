			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(March 2016)</p>
			<p>I worked in a team of 2 to create a fracture generator in Autodesk Maya for our final project in our 3D Graphics class. We used Python to create 4 different types of fractures that can be applied to any mesh. I created the general and local Voronoi fractures (which were used in the path fracture, as well) and the Multi-Plane fracture. My partner created the path fracture, the chip fracture, and the explosion feature. We are very pleased with how it turned out because it is our first practical project, which can be applied to other projects in the future.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This project introduced me to developing tools for use within Maya, and also provided further experience with Python. Beyond that, it also provided a tool that can potentially be used in further projects.</p>
