			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(November 2015)</p>
			<p>For my final project in Physical Computing, I worked in a team of 2 to create an Arduino-powered car with an Arduino remote-control. I did the wiring for the controller and the coding for the controller, I2C connection, and serial-connected Processing application that displayed the direction of the car. We attempted bluetooth communication between car and controller, but ran out of time, so stuck with I2C. We also submitted a wiring diagram completed in Fritzing. I ended up with 97% in that course, the only marks lost being for a Fritzing file that reverted to an earler version from before we cleaned up the wiring diagram.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This project provided further experience with wiring, schematics, and serial communication. We struggled for a few days to get Bluetooth communication working properly before switching to I2C, but it acted as a good introduction, which I built upon when revisiting Bluetooth for Project Marko.</p>
