			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(October 2015 - November 2015)</p>
			<p>Nikko was part of a project aimed at exploring different types of interaction. It was created over a period of 2 months. I worked in a team of 2 to create this side-scroller using Cinder, making use of Leap Motion, an Arduino Photocell, and Audio input to work through different levels. I did all of the programming for this project, while my partner created the art assets. Despite running out of time to polish it to a greater degree, we were applauded for the level of completion, especially considering our reduced team size compared to other groups of 3-4 people. I had to rush the video, so I would like to take the time to record better gameplay footage at some point.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This was my first real programming experience since my last Kinect project in 2012 (which I unfortunately do not have footage of). It was a reintroduction to object-oriented programming and an introduction to Cinder, Leap Motion, and sensor-based interaction. This, along with my ArduinoCar, instilled in me a deep interest in sensors and IOT technology, which I aim to pursue further in the near future.</p>
