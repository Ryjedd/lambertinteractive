				<p>The Canadian Museum of History is the national history museum of Canada, rebranded from the Canadian Museum of Civilization for the 2017 150 year anniversary of Confederation. It is located directly across the river from Parliament in Gatineau, QC.</p>
				<p>I started working here in May 2016 as a Digital Experience Developer on a 3-month student term, which was extended until March 2017 and then again until August. I perform content updates on the museum's Wordpress site, at the request of various parties within the museum, as well as experimenting with different technologies for potential use within different museum situations.</p>
