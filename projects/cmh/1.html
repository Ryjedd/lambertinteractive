			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<P>(July 2016)</p>
			<p>I was tasked by my director with developing a few sample interfaces using the Intuiface software to evaluate its use in developing content for future exhibits. This was my first project, which I geared towards the Children's museum. I wanted to develop a fun way of revealing the content, and the idea of pinatas and popping balloons came to mind. I purposely made the text content minimal, expecting short attention spans. I also implemented x-buttons to close the content, however I was confronted with the idea of what to do after to allow the same content to be chosen again. I already had the balloons floating around the screen, and thought it would be fun to have them slowly float back into view.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This project allowed me to explore fun and unique methods of interaction with multitouch surfaces, while also tapping into my problem solving abilities to a small degree. Furthermore, it gave me the responsibility of evaluating whether the software was worthwhile or not. In the end, I surmised that the software was very easy for visual development, but it presented limitations which made development of larger projects somewhat difficult.</p>
