			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<P>(July 2016)</p>
			<p>This sample was based on a grander idea I had, involving placing replica artifacts on a physical pedestal to activate unique experiences within an exhibit. I still hope to develop a prototype of that system someday, however this was my attempt to create a digital version. I wanted to create an interface where different artifacts could be placed on a central pedestal, which would present content unique to that artifact. This was another introductory excercise to the Intuiface software.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This project allowed me to be creative by continuing to experiment with unique interactions in a multitouch environment. I was given no specific instructions, except to experiment with the Intuiface software and evaluate its potential use in developing content for exhibits.</p>
