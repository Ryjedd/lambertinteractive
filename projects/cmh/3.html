			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<P>(July 2016)</p>
			<p>My director wanted a specific sample to showcase a timeline application, as these are common within history museum exhibits. He specified its use with a multitouch table, meaning several users would be accessing information at one time. With this in mind, I decided to implement a timeline on each end of the table, which would contain the same content and could produce separate instances of the popups to present it. Because this means twice the amount of content can be presented on the screen, the timelines were kept as simplistic as possible, so they do not take up very much of the screen. Furthermore, what is not seen here is that the content can be resized for easier viewing. This project went through multiple iterations as I presented it to my director for feedback.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This was the first project I worked on where I was receiving significant feedback related to its direction. It allowed me the opportunity to listen to the requirements and develop a solution to meet them. It also required me to analyze the feedback and forced me to accept constructive criticism. As I presented each iteration, naturally sure that I had perfected it this time, I listened as certain choices of mine were countered with other ideas, and I either had to defend my choice or accept the alteration. In the end, this back-and-forth, iterative process resulted in a product that both my director and I were satisfied with and which was built upon for future projects.</p>
