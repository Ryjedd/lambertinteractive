			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<P>(July 2016)</p>
			<p>After experimenting with many different types of interactions, I wanted to create a sample based on an upcoming, travelling exhibit to showcase the technology's potential in a real environment. I also wanted to take my time and produce a design that resulted in limited user frustration and high engagement. As I developed the design, I tested with coworkers and friends to catch any errors, and while it would have been better to test with others, this did allow me to catch some issues that I was able to fix, resulting in a much tighter interface. For instance, information was being lost off-screen, so I implemented the push-back feature, which always returns content to the view. I also originally intended a circular motion as the only method of turning the wheel, however it was not 100% reliable, so I allowed swipe gestures, as well. Overall, I was very pleased with how this turned out, as were others within the museum.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This project allowed me to delve into user-centered design and user-testing, albeit not with actual museum visitors. I did, however, have a subject who made it their goal to break the interface, which allowed me to pick out any potential flaws and implement fixes. By the end, there were no perceivable places for error, convincing me that I had performed the appropriate quality assurance for optimal user experience. It was a great experience that helped convince me of the importance of testing and user-centered design.</p>
