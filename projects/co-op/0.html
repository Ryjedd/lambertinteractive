				<p>The Old Co-op is a feed and seed store that has been a staple of the North Gower community for over 100 years. After a few years of closure upon the shutdown of the Co-op brand, it was re-opened as The Old Co-op in 2006 and was bought by my parents in 2011.</p>
				<p>For 5 years, I acted first as assistant manager and then co-manager of The Old Co-op as it grew from a simple feed and seed store to include power equipment, hunting supplies, sheds, kayaks, and much more. While there, I also performed maintance on the website, developed micro-sites for various product lines, and produced marketing materials for various events and general store purposes. I left in 2015 to return to school, however I still help out the odd weekend.</p>
