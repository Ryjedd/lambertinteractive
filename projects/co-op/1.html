			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(2014)</p>
			<p>This site showcases a variety of options for wooden storage sheds at The Old Co-op. There was a lot of information to present, so I decided to segment each page into multiple sections for ease-of-reading. Because there was so much, the pages ended up quite long, so I decided to lock the navigation menu to the bottom of the screen so that users do not have to scroll back to the top to switch pages. I also manage SEO and SEM for this site. I plan to revisit this site soon, using my new experience to enhance it and make it mobile-friendly.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This project provided a refresher on basic web development, as well as an opportunity to experiment with different layouts that I had little exposure to beforehand. It provided a basis for my future learning and experimenting with Javascript and SASS. It also introduced me to SEO and SEM.</p>
