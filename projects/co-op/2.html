			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(2012)</p>
			<p>This site is not currently active, but I was very happy with the way the visual style turned out. It showcased a variety of options for free-range poultry and eggs, and provided educational material regarding the benefits of free-range. Because it is a family-run business, with the kids having a big part, I wanted to use a very cartoonish design with little animations on the menu buttons, which the kids really enjoyed.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>This was my first project for a client, as well as my first web project out of school. It was a good experience in preparing concept art to present to the client and then building the site to meet those designs, which worked out much better than I had expected. Working with a client introduced me to the realities of tempering my own ideas to meet theirs. Some aspects that I thought would enhance the site were altered by the client, and I had to realize that it was their site and their choices trumped mine.</p>
