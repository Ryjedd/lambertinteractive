			<h4>About the Project</h4>
			<p>(2011-2015)</p>
			<p>Throughout my time at The Old Co-op, I dabbled in graphic design, including logos and decals for our chip wagon, event posters, and converting designs to vector format for a local creator of vinyl-printed clothing. I experimented with many different styles and arranged the preparation and printing for many of the final materials.</p>

			<h4>What I Gained from this Project</h4>
			<p>I don't consider myself a designer (I'm a programmer), however these projects allowed me to explore design and experiment with different styles. It also allowed me to develop my Photoshop and Illustrator skills extensively. Working with the vector designs for vinyl printing, for instance, allowed me to become quite adept with the pen tool in Illustrator, as well as dealing with exporting to vector formats.</p>
